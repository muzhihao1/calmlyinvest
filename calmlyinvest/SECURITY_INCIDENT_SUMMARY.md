# üîê Security Incident Summary - 2025-07-31

## Overview
Exposed Supabase API keys were discovered in the public GitHub repository. Immediate action was taken to rotate keys and clean the Git history.

## Timeline of Actions

### 1. Discovery (15:20)
- Found 42 instances of exposed API keys in Git history
- Both `anon` and `service_role` keys were exposed
- Keys were hardcoded in multiple files across 11 commits

### 2. Source Code Cleanup (15:30)
- ‚úÖ Removed all hardcoded API keys from source files
- ‚úÖ Updated code to use environment variables
- ‚úÖ Updated .gitignore to prevent future exposure
- ‚úÖ Created security documentation

### 3. JWT Secret Rotation (15:57 - 16:01)
- ‚úÖ Initiated JWT secret regeneration in Supabase dashboard
- ‚úÖ Process completed successfully
- ‚úÖ Retrieved new API keys
- ‚úÖ Old keys permanently invalidated

### 4. Environment Updates (16:01 - ongoing)
- ‚úÖ Updated local .env files with new keys
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Partially updated Vercel environment variables
  - ‚úÖ SUPABASE_ANON_KEY updated
  - ‚è≥ SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY pending
  - ‚è≥ VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY pending

### 5. Git History Cleanup (15:53)
- ‚úÖ Ran BFG Repo-Cleaner
- ‚úÖ Reduced exposed instances from 42 to 8
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  8 instances remain in protected HEAD commit
- ‚è≥ Force push pending

## Current Security Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- JWT secret rotated - old keys are now invalid
- New API keys generated and stored securely
- Source code cleaned of all hardcoded secrets
- Local environment files updated
- Git history partially cleaned

### ‚ö†Ô∏è  In Progress
- Vercel environment variables update (1/3 completed)
- Final Git history cleanup via force push

### ‚è≥ Pending
- Force push cleaned repository to GitHub
- Complete Vercel environment variable updates
- Audit Supabase access logs
- Consider creating new repository without history
- Delete or privatize old repository

## Security Impact
- **Risk Level**: Previously HIGH, now MEDIUM
- **Old Keys**: Invalidated and no longer functional
- **New Keys**: Securely stored in environment variables
- **Remaining Risk**: 8 instances of old (invalid) keys in Git history

## Next Steps
1. Complete Vercel environment variable updates manually
2. Force push cleaned repository: `git push origin --force --all`
3. Notify any collaborators to re-clone the repository
4. Monitor Supabase access logs for any unauthorized access
5. Consider migrating to a new repository for complete history removal

## Lessons Learned
1. Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
2. Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration
3. Set up pre-commit hooks to prevent secret exposure
4. Regularly audit repositories for exposed secrets
5. Have an incident response plan ready

## Contact
If you discover any security issues or unauthorized access, immediately:
1. Rotate all API keys again
2. Check Supabase access logs
3. Review all recent database activity
4. Contact Supabase support if needed
