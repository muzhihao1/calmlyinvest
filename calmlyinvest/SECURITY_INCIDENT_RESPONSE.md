# URGENT: Security Incident Response - Exposed Supabase Keys

## What Happened
Your Supabase service role key was exposed in a public GitHub repository. This key has full administrative access to your database and can bypass all Row Level Security policies.

## Immediate Actions Taken
✅ Removed `.env.supabase` from Git history  
✅ Force pushed to clean the remote repository  

## Actions You Must Take NOW

### 1. Rotate Your Supabase Keys Immediately
1. Go to https://app.supabase.com/project/hsfthqchyupkbmazcuis/settings/api
2. Under "Project API keys", click "Roll" next to both:
   - `anon` key (public key)
   - `service_role` key (CRITICAL - this was exposed)
3. Copy the new keys

### 2. Update Your Local Environment
1. Update `.env.supabase` with the new keys:
   ```bash
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_new_service_role_key_here
   ```

2. Update `.env` with the new anon key:
   ```bash
   SUPABASE_URL=https://hsfthqchyupkbmazcuis.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_new_anon_key_here
   ```

### 3. Check for Any Unauthorized Access
1. Go to Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Check for any unknown users
3. Check Database → Table Editor for any suspicious data
4. Review Auth Logs for unusual activity

### 4. Update Any Deployed Applications
If you have deployed this app anywhere (Vercel, etc.), update the environment variables there too.

## Prevention for the Future

### Never Commit Sensitive Files
1. Always add sensitive files to `.gitignore` BEFORE creating them
2. Use this checklist before committing:
   - [ ] No `.env*` files in `git status`
   - [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
   - [ ] All sensitive config uses environment variables

### Use git-secrets or similar tools
```bash
# Install git-secrets
brew install git-secrets

# Set up for this repo
git secrets --install
git secrets --register-aws
```

### Best Practices
1. Store production secrets in a secure vault (not in files)
2. Use different keys for development and production
3. Regularly rotate keys
4. Set up GitHub secret scanning alerts

## If You Suspect Unauthorized Access
1. Immediately pause your Supabase project
2. Export your data
3. Contact Supabase support
4. Consider migrating to a new project

## Next Steps
1. Complete all actions above
2. Delete this file after you've secured everything
3. Set a reminder to rotate keys again in 30 days as a precaution
