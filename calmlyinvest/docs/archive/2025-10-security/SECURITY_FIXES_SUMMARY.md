# Security Fixes Summary 🔐

## What Was Found

During the security review before committing, I discovered **actual Supabase API keys** (including the service role key) hardcoded in multiple files throughout the codebase.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Fixed Source Code Files
Removed hardcoded API keys and replaced with environment variable requirements:

- ✅ `/client/src/lib/supabase.ts`
  - Removed: Hardcoded anon key  
  - Now: Requires `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` env vars
  - Added: Error if environment variables are missing

- ✅ `/api/auth/register.ts`
  - Removed: Hardcoded URL and anon key
  - Now: Requires environment variables with fallback support

### 2. Updated .gitignore
Added the following files that contain actual API keys:
```
setup-env.sh
scripts/restore-user-data.ts
scripts/restore-via-api.ts
VERCEL_ENV_VARS_GUIDE.md
SECURITY_KEY_ROTATION_COMPLETE.md
```

### 3. Created Security Documentation
- 📄 `SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md` - Comprehensive pre-commit security checklist
- 📄 `.env.example` - Safe template for environment variables
- 📄 This summary file

## Files Still Containing Keys (Now in .gitignore)

These files still have hardcoded keys but are now ignored by git:
- `setup-env.sh` - Shell script with all keys
- `scripts/restore-user-data.ts` - Has anon key
- `scripts/restore-via-api.ts` - Has OLD service role key  
- `VERCEL_ENV_VARS_GUIDE.md` - Documentation with actual keys
- `SECURITY_KEY_ROTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Security incident doc with keys

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NEXT STEPS

1. **Before Committing:**
   ```bash
   # Run security scan
   grep -r "eyJhbGci" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git
   
   # Check git status
   git status
   
   # Verify sensitive files are not staged
   git diff --cached
   ```

2. **Rotate Keys (Recommended):**
   Since these keys were in the codebase, consider rotating them:
   - Go to Supabase dashboard > Settings > API
   - Generate new anon and service role keys
   - Update all environment variables

3. **Update Environment Variables:**
   - Local `.env` file
   - Vercel dashboard environment variables
   - Any other deployment environments

## Security Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Never commit `.env` files**
2. **Always use environment variables for sensitive data**
3. **Review `git diff` before every commit**
4. **Use `.env.example` with placeholder values**
5. **Run security scans regularly**

## Files Safe to Commit

After these fixes, the following are safe to commit:
- All files in `/api/` directory (serverless functions)
- Updated `/client/src/lib/supabase.ts`
- Updated `.gitignore`
- All documentation files (except those in .gitignore)
- Test scripts (without credentials)

**Remember**: The keys found in this codebase should be considered compromised. Rotate them as soon as possible!
