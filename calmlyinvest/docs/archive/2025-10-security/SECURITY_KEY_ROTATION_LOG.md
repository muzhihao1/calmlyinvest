# Security Key Rotation Log

## üîê JWT Secret Rotation - 2025-07-31

### Issue Discovered
- Supabase API keys (both anon and service_role) were exposed in public GitHub repository
- Repository: https://github.com/muzhihao1/calmlyinvest.git
- 42 instances of sensitive keys found in Git history across 11 commits

### Actions Taken

#### 1. ‚úÖ Source Code Cleanup (Completed)
- Removed all hardcoded API keys from source files
- Updated code to use environment variables
- Created security documentation

#### 2. ‚úÖ JWT Secret Rotation (In Progress - Started at 15:57)
- Initiated JWT secret regeneration through Supabase dashboard
- Process will:
  - Generate new anon and service_role keys
  - Invalidate the exposed keys
  - Restart the project (may take up to 2 minutes)
  - Force sign out active users
  - Invalidate all Storage pre-signed URLs

### Next Steps

1. **Wait for Rotation to Complete** (2 minutes)
   - Check status at approximately 15:59

2. **Retrieve New Keys**
   - Go to Legacy API Keys page
   - Copy new anon key
   - Reveal and copy new service_role key

3. **Update Environment Variables**
   - Local .env file
   - Vercel dashboard
   - Any other deployment environments

4. **Clean Git History**
   - Run deep-clean-git-history.sh script
   - Force push to GitHub
   - Consider creating new repository

5. **Security Audit**
   - Check Supabase access logs
   - Look for any unauthorized access
   - Monitor for suspicious activity

### Important Notes
- Old keys are permanently invalidated
- Application will experience downtime during rotation
- All users will be signed out
- Update must be completed within 20 minutes to avoid cooldown

### Timeline
- 15:20 - Discovered exposed keys
- 15:30 - Cleaned source code
- 15:57 - Initiated JWT rotation
- 15:59 - JWT rotation completed successfully
- 16:00 - Retrieved new API keys
- 16:01 - Updated local .env files

### ‚úÖ Key Rotation Completed

#### New Keys (Generated 2025-07-31)
- New keys have been successfully generated and stored in:
  - `.env` file - updated with new anon and service_role keys
  - `.env.supabase` file - updated with new anon and service_role keys
- Old exposed keys are now permanently invalidated

### Security Status
- ‚úÖ JWT secret rotated
- ‚úÖ New API keys generated
- ‚úÖ Local environment files updated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Vercel environment variables - partially updated (SUPABASE_ANON_KEY done, others pending)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Git history cleanup - partially complete (reduced from 42 to 8 instances)
- ‚è≥ Repository migration - pending
- ‚è≥ Force push cleaned repository - pending

### Git History Cleanup Results
- Initial exposed instances: 42
- After BFG cleanup: 8 instances remain
