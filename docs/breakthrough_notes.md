# Breakthrough Notes: API 404 Fix

## Date: 2025-08-01

### Problem Summary
The Vercel deployment was returning 404 errors for all API endpoints because Vercel expects serverless functions in `/api/` at the repository root, but the actual API files were located in `/calmlyinvest/api/`.

### Root Cause
- Vercel's function detection looks for files matching `api/**/*.ts` from the repository root
- The application's API files are in a subdirectory: `/calmlyinvest/api/`
- This mismatch caused Vercel to not find and deploy any serverless functions

### Solution Implemented
Created a build-time solution that copies API files from `/calmlyinvest/api/` to `/api/` before Vercel builds the application.

### Files Created/Modified

1. **Scripts Created**:
   - `/scripts/copy-api-files.js` - Copies API files during build
   - `/scripts/verify-api-copy.js` - Verifies the copy was successful
   - `/scripts/rollback-api-copy.js` - Removes copied files if needed

2. **Configuration Modified**:
   - `/vercel.json` - Updated buildCommand to include API copy step

3. **Test Files Created**:
   - `/repro/test-api-endpoint.html` - Browser-based API endpoint tester

### How It Works

1. During Vercel build, the buildCommand now runs:
   ```
   node scripts/copy-api-files.js && cd calmlyinvest && npm run build
   ```

2. The copy script:
   - Creates `/api/` directory at repository root
   - Recursively copies all `.ts` files from `/calmlyinvest/api/`
   - Preserves directory structure (auth/, portfolio/, etc.)

3. Vercel then finds the functions in `/api/` and deploys them correctly

### Verification Steps (5 minutes)

1. **Local Verification**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/verify-api-copy.js
   ```
   This will copy files and show the resulting structure.

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix API 404 errors by copying API files to root during build"
   git push
   ```

3. **Test Deployed Endpoints**:
   - Open `/repro/test-api-endpoint.html` in a browser
   - Click "Run All Tests"
   - All tests should show green success status

4. **Alternative: Manual Test**:
   ```bash
   curl https://calmlyinvest.vercel.app/api/health
   # Should return: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}
   ```

### Rollback Procedure

If the solution causes issues:

1. **Remove copied files**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/rollback-api-copy.js
   ```

2. **Revert vercel.json**:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD -- vercel.json
   ```

3. **Deploy revert**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Revert API copy solution"
   git push
   ```

### Why This Solution Works

1. **Non-invasive**: Doesn't change application structure
2. **Build-time only**: No runtime overhead
3. **Vercel-compatible**: Works with Vercel's function detection
4. **Maintainable**: Clear scripts with single responsibility
5. **Reversible**: Easy rollback if needed

### Alternative Solutions Considered

1. **Symbolic links**: Not reliable on all systems, Git complications
2. **Moving files permanently**: Would break local development
3. **Changing Vercel config**: Limited options for function paths

### Lessons Learned

- Vercel's function detection is strict about file locations
- Build-time transformations are effective for deployment issues
- Always create rollback procedures for infrastructure changes
- Test files are crucial for verifying API deployments

### Next Steps

After deployment verification:
1. Monitor API performance
2. Set up automated endpoint monitoring
3. Consider CI/CD tests for API availability
4. Document this pattern for future Vercel projects
